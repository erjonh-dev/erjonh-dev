## Hi, I'm Erjon Havolli 

I'm a Junior Full Stack Developer who has recently built several web apps, each one sparking more excitement for development.
These projects have allowed me to grow my skills.

I'm currently looking for a Junior Full Stack Developer role where I can continue to learn, grow, and contribute within a collaborative team.
